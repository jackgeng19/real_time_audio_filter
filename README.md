<h2>IntroductionðŸ’¬</h2>

<p>ðŸ”ŠTinnitus is a common condition where a person hears ringing or other sounds in the ear even when there is no external sound. Tonal tinnitus is a type of tinnitus where the person hears a steady, continuous tone. This real-time notch filter aims to alleviate tonal tinnitus symptoms by removing the frequency of the tinnitus frequency from the audio stream in real-time.</p>

<h2>How to UseðŸ“š</h2>

<p>Clone the repository to your pc. </p>
<p>Install required packages: numpy, scipy, and PyAudio.</p>
<p>Open the terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.</p>
<p>Run the script using the command python3 real_time_tonal_tinnitus_notch_filter.py.</p>
<p>Adjust the frequency of the notch filter to match the frequency of your tinnitus tone by changing the notch_frequency variable in the script.</p>
<h5>We are on our way toðŸš€: the script will run in the background, filtering out the tinnitus tone from the audio stream in real-time.</h5>
