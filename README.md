# Real-Time Tonal Tinnitus Notch Filter
A real-time notch filter designed to alleviate tonal tinnitus symptoms through removing specific frequency of tinnitus tone from audio stream.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Tinnitus is a common condition where a person hears ringing or other sounds in the ear even when there is no external sound. Tonal tinnitus is a type of tinnitus where the person hears a steady, continuous tone. This real-time notch filter aims to alleviate tonal tinnitus symptoms by removing the frequency of the tinnitus tone from the audio stream in real-time.

<h3>How to Use</h3>
Clone the repository to your pc. 
Install required packages: numpy, scipy, and PyAudio.
Open the terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.
Run the script using the command python3 real_time_tonal_tinnitus_notch_filter.py.
Adjust the frequency of the notch filter to match the frequency of your tinnitus tone by changing the notch_frequency variable in the script.
On our way to this target: The script will then run in the background, filtering out the tinnitus tone from the audio stream in real-time.
